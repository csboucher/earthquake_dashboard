    <h4>A Century of Earthquakes in The East African Rift Zone</h4>
    <h5>Hypothesis: The earthquakes in the East African Rift System are shallow (less than 25km) and have seismic variations due to the volcanism in the area. </h5>

<h5>There are many earthquakes that are at a 33km depth which is slightly deeper than expected but is still reasonable for
    the shallow lithosphere in the rift. There are a few approximately 5.0 magnitude outliers that happened at a depth
    greater than 33km depth. The seismicity does vary but this could also be from an increase in seismometers deployed. </h5>
